module: cp4s_query_incidents

short_description: A Module used to query Cases/Incidents in CP4S or Resilient

# If this is part of a collection, you need to use semantic versioning,
# i.e. the version is of the form "2.5.0" and not "2.4".
version_added: "1.0.0"

description: This module is an example of how you can choose to use a module or a role to achieve a similar outcome. An almost identical piece of functionality exists in the CP4S role but this gives a programmatic way to do it.

options:
    conditions:
        description:
            - list of conditions to query
            - [field, value, method] if querying one field
            - [ [field, value, method], [field, value, method] ] if multiple field query is desired
        required: true
        type: list

        type: string
    multiple_fields:
