module: cp4s_create_incident

short_description: A Module used to create an Case in CP4S or Resilient

# If this is part of a collection, you need to use semantic versioning,
# i.e. the version is of the form "2.5.0" and not "2.4".
version_added: "1.0.0"

description: This module is an example of how you can choose to use a module or a role to achieve a similar outcome. An almost identical piece of functionality exists in the CP4S role but this gives a programmatic way to do it.
